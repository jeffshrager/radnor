  '(Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered  weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
    While I nodded  nearly napping  suddenly there came a tapping 
As of some one gently rapping  rapping at my chamber door 
  Tis some visitor   I muttered   tapping at my chamber door 
            Only this and nothing more

    Ah  distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor 
    Eagerly I wished the morrow  vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore 
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore 
            Nameless here for evermore 

    And the silken  sad  uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before 
    So that now  to still the beating of my heart  I stood repeating
      Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door 
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door  
            This it is and nothing more  

    Presently my soul grew stronger  hesitating then no longer 
 Sir   said I   or Madam  truly your forgiveness I implore 
    But the fact is I was napping  and so gently you came rapping 
    And so faintly you came tapping  tapping at my chamber door 
That I scarce was sure I heard you  here I opened wide the door  
            Darkness there and nothing more 

    Deep into that darkness peering  long I stood there wondering  fearing 
Doubting  dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before 
    But the silence was unbroken  and the stillness gave no token 
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word   Lenore? 
This I whispered  and an echo murmured back the word   Lenore   
            Merely this and nothing more 

    Back into the chamber turning  all my soul within me burning 
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before 
     Surely   said I   surely that is something at my window lattice 
      Let me see  then  what thereat is  and this mystery explore 
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore  
             Tis the wind and nothing more  

    Open here I flung the shutter  when  with many a flirt and flutter 
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore 
    Not the least obeisance made he  not a minute stopped or stayed he 
    But  with mien of lord or lady  perched above my chamber door 
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door 
            Perched  and sat  and nothing more 

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling 
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore 
 Though thy crest be shorn and shaven  thou   I said   art sure no craven 
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore 
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night s Plutonian shore  
            Quoth the Raven  Nevermore  

    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly 
Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore 
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door 
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door 
            With such name as  Nevermore  

    But the Raven  sitting lonely on the placid bust  spoke only
That one word  as if his soul in that one word he did outpour 
    Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered 
    Till I scarcely more than muttered  Other friends have flown before 
On the morrow he will leave me  as my Hopes have flown before  
            Then the bird said  Nevermore  

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken 
 Doubtless   said I   what it utters is its only stock and store
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore 
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            Of  Never nevermore   

    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling 
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird  and bust and door 
    Then  upon the velvet sinking  I betook myself to linking
    Fancy unto fancy  thinking what this ominous bird of yore 
What this grim  ungainly  ghastly  gaunt  and ominous bird of yore
            Meant in croaking  Nevermore  

    This I sat engaged in guessing  but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom s core 
    This and more I sat divining  with my head at ease reclining
    On the cushion s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o er 
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o er 
            She shall press  ah  nevermore 

    Then  methought  the air grew denser  perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor 
     Wretch   I cried   thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee
    Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore 
Quaff  oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore  
            Quoth the Raven  Nevermore  

     Prophet   said I   thing of evil  prophet still  if bird or devil  
Whether Tempter sent  or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore 
    Desolate yet all undaunted  on this desert land enchanted 
    On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly  I implore 
Is there is there balm in Gilead? tell me tell me  I implore  
            Quoth the Raven  Nevermore  

     Prophet   said I   thing of evil  prophet still  if bird or devil 
By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore 
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if  within the distant Aidenn 
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore 
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore  
            Quoth the Raven  Nevermore  

     Be that word our sign of parting  bird or fiend   I shrieked  upstarting 
 Get thee back into the tempest and the Night s Plutonian shore 
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken 
    Leave my loneliness unbroken  quit the bust above my door 
Take thy beak from out my heart  and take thy form from off my door  
            Quoth the Raven  Nevermore  

    And the Raven  never flitting  still is sitting  still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door 
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s that is dreaming 
    And the lamp-light o er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor 
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
    Shall be lifted nevermore ))
